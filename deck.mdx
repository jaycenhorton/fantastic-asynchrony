# Fantastic Asynchrony and How to Find It

---

# The problem

Spawning any number of parallel jobs upon a datastore entitiy's
property update <b>without interrupting the initial async operation</b>.

<Notes>
  It is often desired to trigger additional jobs based on an initial operation.
  Often, those jobs require a chain of async/await calls to execute sequentially
  in order to look up relevant properties for use in the newly spawned jobs.
  Unfortunately, due to the way JS's event loop works, consuming async/await to
  look up the data for those additional jobs would cause a delay in the initial
  job's finalization. As such, a pattern is needed to spawn new tasks in
  entirely different contexts.
